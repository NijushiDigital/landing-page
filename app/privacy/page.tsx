          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information from third parties</strong> — if you connect a third-party account
            or if a client shares data with us to deliver a service, we may receive additional
            information in accordance with the permissions granted.

          We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with trusted third-party
          vendors (hosting, analytics, payment processors) solely to operate our Services. These
          parties are contractually required to protect your data and may not use it for their own
          purposes.

        <p className="mt-3">
          We may disclose data if required by law, court order, or to protect the rights and safety
          of our users or the public.
        </p>
      </Section>
